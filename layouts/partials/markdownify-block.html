    The 'markdownify' function removes the surrounding <p> and </p> tags
    if and only if the result is a single-line/block.  But this means that
    the results are inconsistent: sometimes the result is flow-level (for
    simple cases), and sometimes it's block-level (for multi-line or complex
    cases).

    There's no "leave the wrapping <p> in place" option to markdownify, so we
    have to work around it ourselves.  We attempt to recognize all possible
    block-level tags to know whether the result "looks like blocks" or not, and
    then add a wrapping <p> if we think it's needed.

    To use: {{ partial "markdownify-block" .value.with.markdown }}
